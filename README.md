# ASP.NET Core 9 Authentication and Authorization System

Welcome to the **ASP.NET Core 9 Authentication and Authorization System** repository. This repository provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core 9, as documented in the tutorial series on [The Coding Blueprint](https://www.thecodingblueprint.com/unlock-the-secrets-of-asp-net-core-9-authentication-and-authorization-a-powerful-step-by-step-guide-part-1/).

## Overview

Authentication and authorization are critical components in modern web application security. This project focuses on setting up a robust and flexible authentication and authorization system using ASP.NET Core 9. The implementation is designed to be scalable, secure, and adhere to best practices.

### Key Features

- **User Story Definition**: Detailed requirements for a real-world authentication system.
- **Project Structure**: Organizing the project with a modular and maintainable structure.
- **Authentication Flow**: Implementation of secure login and token-based authentication.
- **Authorization Policies**: Role-based and claims-based authorization strategies.
- **Extensibility**: Designed for customization and integration with third-party systems.
